## How to Add Your Data
1. Go to the [FET Lab Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14_Pz8O_YQauf5cpMfGmqNgqhk9FnoIfN?usp=sharing). To access this folder, you should use CEEO Google account (FirstName.LastName@tuftsceeo.org)
2. Add data
- Add personal information to the `people` spreadsheets
- Add project information to the `projects` spreadsheets  
- You can find tips that you can refer to fill out the data if you **hover cells on top**  
- **Grey columns** are necessary, white columns are optional, and blue columns are for a website manager
3. Upload files (e.g., images, videos, gifs) to the `assets` folder, get a sharable link, and paste to the spreadsheets
- Upload your headshot image to the `assets/people` folder
- Create your project folder with your project id under the `assets` folder and upload images/videos of your projects
